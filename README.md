# WoWTrace Backend (WIP)

## Philosophy 
The backend project is intended to extract all the necessary information for the website from the Blizzard data so that the website does not need access to any blizzard data.

## Setup
1. Configurate your settings in settings.json file (automaticly created after first start)
2. Run update.sh
3. dotnet WoWtrace.Backend.dll
